## Introduce

MES-U is a web-based open source Manufacturing Execution System (MES) developed by ©Sindoh.

The system is developed based on functions of our previous MES used on our manufacturing sites and know-how gained from it. We share the program as a open source software for those who interests in MES. The current version (v1) provides core functions and master data needed on the manufacturing sites. We'll improve the program by adding more enhanced functions for manufacturing sites such as inventory and material management.
